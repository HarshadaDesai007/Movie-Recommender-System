# Movie-Recommender-System
Recommender systems are at the core of pretty much every online service we interact with. Social networking sites like Facebook, Twitter and Instagram recommend posts you might like, or people you might know. Video streaming services like YouTube and Netflix recommend videos, movies or TV shows you might like. Online shopping sites like Amazon recommend products you might want to buy.
